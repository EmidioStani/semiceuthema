<p>
	The Core Criterion and Core Evidence Vocabulary (CCCEV) is designed to support the exchange of information between organisations or persons (more generally agents) defining requirements and organisations or persons responding to these requirements by means of structured or unstructured evidences.
</p>
<p>
	The Core Criterion and Core Evidence Vocabulary (CCCEV) contains two basic and complementary core concepts:
	<ul>
		<li>
			The requirement, something used as the basis for making a judgement or decision, e.g. a requirement set in a public tender or a condition that has to be fulfilled for a public service to be executed; and
		</li>
		<li>
			The evidence, the data proving or disproving that a requirement is met or has been fulfilled, in particular an evidence is used to prove that a specific requirement is met by someone or by something.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	CCCEV is shaping a general framework around these core concepts. However, implementations have to make decisions on how the framework is actually used by elaborating further the Core Vocabulary to make it applicable in their specific context.

{% block implementationNote %}
<p>
  CCCEV as a Core Vocabulary is implementation neutral. CCCEV does not impose any choices regarding how the data is being exchanged. Furthermore, CCCEV does not enforce the information carried in an Evidence to be directly accessible i.e. contained within the payload of the response. However, CCCEV does offer several ways to implement these aspects: (1) via subclassing of the Evidence class, (2) via sharing it as a DCAT:Distribution or (3) via the class Supported Value. These are three distinguishable approaches, which can be used independently from each other, or in combination.
</p>
</br>
<p>
  CCCEV provides a framework for the implementers to define the actual information models and metadata models an Evidence should comply to. For example, a Birth Certificate model could be defined as a particular Evidence Type to which the Evidence shared by the competent authority should conform to. This information model would make use of metadata models existing. The implementer can define one or several domain specific models for defining the information acceptable or required within an Evidence.
</p>
</br>
<p>
  In practice, an Evidence (from the perspective of being a document) often provides more information than is required for the decision making process. Despite that it might be possible to express all these information pieces as Information Concepts, this remains a choice for the implementer. It is not the intent of CCCEV to provide a full fledged data modeling framework with the notion of Information Concept and Supported Value. Usages such as creating Information Concepts independent from Requirements or providing Values for Information Concepts that are not requested by a Requirement should be considered as unintended usages, beyond the scope of CCCEV.
