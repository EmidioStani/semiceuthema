{% block summary %}
<p>
	The Core Business Vocabulary provides a minimum set of classes and properties for
    legal entities, that is, trading bodies that are formally registered with the relevant authority and that appear in
    business registers. This excludes sole traders, virtual organisations and other types of 'agents'
    that are able to do business.
